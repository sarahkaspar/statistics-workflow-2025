</figure><p>Let’s start with an example, and thereby define some terminology. We
have a lake with frogs in it, and there are light and dark green frogs.
There’s a sunny side of the lake, and a shadowy area by the trees. Now
imagine you want to estimate the fraction of light green frogs in the
lake. There are too many frogs to count them all, so you catch a few and
count how many of them are light coloured. This is a sample. A
<strong>sample</strong> are randomly independently drawn events from a
<strong>population of interest</strong>. The population of interest, in
this case, are all the frogs in that lake. How can we draw
<strong>randomly and independently</strong>? One obvious thing you could
randomize in this experiment is the location at which you cath the
frogs, because from the above picture you could get the impression that
light-coloured frogs gather more in the shadows, while the dark-green
frogs like the sun. Therefore, if we caught all the frogs in the same
area, like in sample 1, this would probably over-represent light frogs,
thus not representing the population well. When randomizing the
locations, this is less likely to be the case (see for example sample
2). You get similar problems if the observations are not independent.
One example of dependent observations would be if you start with one
frog, then catch the one right next to it, and so on. This is also
likely to over-represent one colour of frogs, and the reason why
observations shouldn’t depend on each other. The <strong>sample
size</strong> is the number of frogs in one sample.</p></section><section id="aio-02-distributions"><p>Content from <a href="02-distributions.html">What is a probability distribution?</a></p>

<p>Most data analyses assume that data comes from some distribution. A
probability distribution assigns probabilities to possible outcomes of
an experiment. In terms of sampling, even if the sampling is supposed to
be random, it doesn’t mean that there are no rules – so one could say
that the probability distribution defines the rules for randomness.</p>
<p>Let’s get back to our example of the lake of frogs, which is
inhabited by light and dark green frogs. Let’s say, the true fraction of
light green frogs is <span class="math inline">\(1/3\)</span>, and you
decide sample of <span class="math inline">\(n=10\)</span> frogs from
that lake at random. Then, if you count the number of light-colored
frogs within that net, there are 11 possible outcomes: The number can be
between 0 and 10.</p>
<p>Below, you see a plot out of this, where each of these events has a
probability. A suitable distribution for describing this scenario is the
<em>binomial distribution</em>, which assumes a number of trials (frog
catches) which can have two outcomes (light, dark).</p>
<figure><img src="fig/sampling-frogs-2.png" width="500" alt="possible outcomes of sampling ten frogs" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Binomial sampling</div>
</figure><p>If the true fraction of light frogs is one third, then the most
likely outcome is catching 3 light frogs. Seeing 10 light frogs is
rather unlikely: The probability is close to zero, and we would consider
this a rare event.</p>

<p>There are two types of probability distributions: discrete and
continuous.</p>
<p>A <strong>discrete distribution</strong> is what we have just seen,
in this case the observations can only take integer values, in our
example the counts from 0 to 10. In between those values, the
probabilities are zero, that’s why it’s called a probability mass
function: The probability mass is on defined points.</p>
<p>In a <strong>continuous distribution</strong>, we have a probability
density function. An example is the Gaussian distribution. That would be
suitable if we measured the sizes of frogs, and they are well described
by a mean size and a variance. On a continuous scale, there are
infinitely many values, so that the probability for a specific value,
for example a frog size of exactly 9cm is zero. What makes sense instead
is to ask for the probability of an observation to fall into a certain
interval, for example between 8 and 10 cm, and we get this probability
from integrating over the probability density function.</p>

<p>The binomial distribution is what we have just seen in the example:
We use it when we have a fixed sample size and count the number of
“successes” in that sample. Examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>how many locations in the genome carry a mutation</li>
<li>the number of cells within a sample that show a certain
phenotype</li>
<li>how many patients out of 100 have a certain disease</li>
<li>how many out of 10 frogs are light green</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="fig/sampling-frogs-2.png" alt="possible outcomes of sampling 10 frogs" width="500" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>The binomial model has two parameters, which means the probabilities
for the individual outcomes depend on two things: - <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of trials, or frogs, or
patients, and it’s fixed. - <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is
the success probability.</p>
<p>Then the probability of observing <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> successes out of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> draws (for example <span class="math inline">\(k=4\)</span> light coloured frogs out of <span class="math inline">\(N=10\)</span>) can be described by this
formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(X=k) = {n\choose
k}p^k(1-p)^k\]</span></p>
<p>You don’t have to remember this piece of math – it’s just to make the
point that you can calculate the probability of an event that is modeled
with the binomial distribution, if you know the success probability
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and the number of trials <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, i.e. the parameters.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>In the binomial we just define a particular outcome as success, for
example a light-coloured frog, or a patient with disease, even though
that may not be a favourable outcome.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here is what the distribution looks like for a success probability of
0.3 and a sample size of 10.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/binomial.png" width="500" alt="example graph for binomial probability distribution" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">The binomial distribution</div>
</figure><p>The expected value of the binomial is <span class="math inline">\(n

the probability of being light-green is 0.3, then we expect to catch 3
light-green frogs on average.</p></section><section id="aio-08-gaussian"><p>Content from <a href="08-gaussian.html">The Gaussian distribution</a></p>

<p>In this episode, I’ll introduce the most common visualizations for
empirical distributions. In the following episodes, we’ll see how to
produce them in R.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="the-histogram">The histogram<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-histogram"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<figure><img src="fig/histogram.png" alt="histogram plot" width="800" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Once we have fitted a distribution to the data, we can visually
compare the theory, that is the fitted distribution, to the actual data
and decide whether this is a good fit. One very common thing to look at
is the histogram. The more data points you have, the more it resembles
the underlying probability distribution. So we could look at this
histogram here and check whether it looks similar to the Gaussian shape,
shown in blue. A problem about this plot is that, as you might have
noticed already, a lot of distributions look roughly bell-shaped. And
often it’s difficult to tell subtle differences from a histogram.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="the-cumulative-distribution">The cumulative distribution<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-cumulative-distribution"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>This is why it is also useful to look at the cumulative distribution.
<strong>For every value <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, the
cumulative distribution gives the percentage of data points that have a
smaller value than this <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</strong></p>
<figure><img src="fig/histogram-cumulative.png" alt="histogram and ecdf plot" width="800" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>In this case, you can look up a certain frog size, and the graph will
tell you what percentage of frogs is smaller than that. For example, if
we look up the size of 6 cm, the cumulative distribution tells us that
roughly 75% of the frogs in the sample are smaller than 6 cm. The
empirical cumulative distribution comes from the data, and one little
step for each data point. The theoretical distribution gives the
percentage of data points that you’d expect to be smaller than a certain
value, for the distribution that you are comparing to. In this graph,
it’s often easier to see systematic deviations from the expectation, for
example here the blue line is substantially steeper than the black line,
so maybe here we are comparing to a theoretical distribution with a too
low variance.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="the-qq-plot">The QQ-plot<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-qq-plot"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Another useful plot is the QQ-plot. It’s very often used for checking
whether the data is normal, but it can also be used for comparing to
other distributions.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/histogram-cumulative-qq.png" alt="histogram, ecdf, and qq plot" width="800" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Here, we plot sample quantiles against theoretical quantiles. The
25th quantile is the value <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> at
which 25% of the data points are smaller then k. You can determine the
quantile for each data point, and compare it to theory, so each point in
this plot is a comparison between theory and data. The nice thing about
this plot is that when the theory and data match well, all points end up
on a straight line. And it’s easy for our eyes to decide whether
something is a straight line or not.</p>

<p>When we say we “fit” a distribution, we are usually talking about the
<em>maximum likelihood approach</em>. This means we find the parameters
for which it is most likely to see the given data. This is an
optimization problem - and thus can be solved conveniently by the
computer. You might also hear people say they <em>minimize the
deviance</em> when they fit data, and this is just another term for
minimizing the distance between the line (theory) and the points (data).
The exact mathematical formula for the deviance to be minimized depends
on the type of distribution we are fitting to – for example, when
fitting a Gaussian distribution, we minimize the sum of squares. But no
worries: The tools for fitting that you’ll get to know in this tutorial
know their formulae :)</p>

<p>What is a hypothesis test, and why do we need it? Consider the
following example:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/01-example.png" width="500" alt="mice with different diets" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Mice with different diets</div>
</figure><p>Researchers want to show that mice that are fed with a special “high
fat” diet, grow to a different weight than mice that live on a normal,
control diet. They feed a group of mice with the control diet, and
another group of mice with the high fat diet. After a couple of weeks,
they measure the weight.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/01-mice-plot.png" width="600" alt="Graph with mice weight measurements" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Does the diet affect the mice’s weight?</div>
</figure><p>The above graph shows you a subset of a real data set from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15561913/" class="external-link">this paper</a>. You see
the individual control mice on the left, and the high fat mice on the
right. The boxes that are overlaid indicate the median weights of both
groups. The <strong>scientific question</strong> is whether the high fat
diet has an impact on the weight. And phrased in a quantitative manner,
we can ask whether there is a difference in weight between the mice from
the two different groups. On the graph we certainly see a difference in
means, but the problem is, of course, that <strong>this difference could
be due to chance</strong>. Because we only have a sample of mice for
each diet, and there is obviously some variation in the mouse weights.
The good news is: If we know the rules for this variation, we can
calculate how likely it is to see this difference by chance – which is
exactly what a statistical test does.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="a-statistical-model">A statistical model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#a-statistical-model"></a>
</h3>
<p>When testing, we assume a statistical model for the data, for example
we say that the weight of the individual mice is the composed of the
diet effect (in this case the group means), plus something called
residuals, which describe the effect of variation, and which follow a
some distribution. If we measure mice weights, we will most likely
assume that the residuals follow a Gaussian distribution, that means the
weights show a bell shaped distribution around the group means.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="null-and-alternative-model">Null and alternative model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#null-and-alternative-model"></a>
</h3>
<p>Actually, it’s not only one model, but two: The null model, and the
alternative model, which describe the null and the alternative
hypothesis.</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We start by assuming that there is nothing to see in the data. This
is called the null hypothesis. In this case, the null hypothesis is that
there is no difference between the two groups of mice. This is described
by the <strong>null model</strong>, where the data are sufficiently
described by an overall average weight (not distinguishing between
diets) and individual differences, called residuals. We reject the null
hypothesis when – assuming it was true – it would be very unlikely to
observe a difference as extreme as in our data just by chance.<br>
In this case, we accept the alternative hypothesis – that there is a
difference in weights. This hypothesis is described by an
<strong>alternative model</strong>, which includes the diet as a
variable. So in summary, we use quantitative models to be able to
calculate the probability of our data under the hypothesis that we want
to test.</p>

<p>Throughout the next episodes, we consider a research project where we
want to find out whether the prevalence of a disease in a test group is
different from the population average. We’ll conduct a very simple test
to answer that question.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/02-disease-prevalence.png" width="500" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Example: Disease prevalence</div>
</figure><p>Suppose There is a disease with a known prevalence of 4%. This means,
4% of the whole population have this disease. Now you are interested in
whether a certain pre-condition, let’s say overweight, or living in a
certain area, changes the risk of getting the disease. You take 100
persons with this precondition and you check the disease prevalence
within the test group. 9 out of the 100 test persons have the
disease.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="null-and-alternative-hypothesis">Null and alternative hypothesis<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#null-and-alternative-hypothesis"></a>
</h3>
<p>This is how we can formalize the hypotheses: Our <strong>null
hypothesis</strong> is the “boring” outcome. If there is nothing to see
in the data, then the prevalence in the test group is also 4%, just as
in the whole population. We want to collect evidence against this
hypothesis. If we have enough evidence against the null, we reject it,
and accept the alternative hypothesis that the prevalence in the test
group differs from 4%. This test is so easy, because the null model is
simply the well-known binomial distribution with a sample size of 100
and a probability of 4%:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ H_O: X \sim Bin(N=100,
p=0.04)\]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-null-distribution">The null distribution<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-null-distribution"></a>
</h3>
<p>We can look at this distribution:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/02-null-distribution.png" width="500" alt="binomial probability distribution of number of patients with disease" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">The null distribution</div>
</figure><p>It gives us the probabilities of seeing <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> cases out of 100 with the disease,
given that each individual has a probability of 4% of having this
disease. This distribution peaks at 4 out of a 100, which makes sense:
You expect to see around 4 out of a 100 when the probability is 4%. We,
on the other hand, observed 9 out of a 100. Now we can ask: How likely
is it to see an event at least as extreme as 9 out of 100, assuming the
null hypothesis, and thus the distribution above, is true. In this case,
the probability of observing 9 or more persons with the disease is
0.019, this is rather unlikely, and we will conclude that the null
hypothesis is likely false.</p>

<h3 id="decision-do-we-reject-the-null-hypothesis">Decision: Do we reject the null hypothesis?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#decision-do-we-reject-the-null-hypothesis"></a>
</h3>
<p>At what probability should you decide to reject the null hypothesis?
This choice is rather arbitrary. It depends on how sure you want to be
that there is really something to see in the data set. <strong>A
wide-spread convention is to call the result significant if the
probability under the null hypothesis is smaller than 5%.</strong> We
say that you choose a significance level alpha of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=5 \%\)</span>. In our example, with a
significance level of 5%, all observations above 8 out of 100, shown in
red, would be called significant.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="recap">Recap<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#recap"></a>
</h3>
<p>Here is what we have just seen:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a <strong>test group</strong> of persons with a precondition, 9
out of 100 have the disease of interest.<br>
</li>
<li>We compare to a <strong>known prevalence</strong> of 4%, that means
4% of the entire population have the disease, when not distinguishing
between persons with and without the precondition.<br>
</li>
<li>We want to know whether the observed 9 out of 100 are significantly
different from 4%. The <strong>null hypothesis</strong> thus is that
they are <em>not</em>.</li>
<li>The <strong>alternative hypothesis</strong> is that the prevalence
in the test group differs from 4%.<br>
</li>
<li>As we have 100 cases and a binary outcome (disease or no disease), a
suitable <strong>null model</strong> is a binomial distribution with
<span class="math inline">\(n=100\)</span> and success probability <span class="math inline">\(p=0.04\)</span>.</li>

<p>Programming languages such as Python or R have functions for
calculating probabilities under different distributions.</p>
<p>In our scenario, we want to calculate the probability of observing 9

</figure><p>What you’ve seen in the last episode was a <strong>one-sided
test</strong>, which means we looked at only at one side of the
distribution. In this example, we observed 9 out of 100 persons with
disease, then we asked: What is the probability under the null, to
observe at least 9 persons with that disease. And we rejected all the
outcomes where this probability was lower than 5%. The alternative
hypothesis that we then take on is that the prevalence is larger than
4%. But we could just as well have looked in the other direction and
have asked: What is the probability of seeing at most the observed
number of diseased under the null, and then in case of rejecting the
null, we’d have accept the alternative hypothesis that the prevalence is
below 4%.</p>
<p>Let me remind you how we initially phrased the research question and
the alternative hypothesis: We wanted to test whether the prevalence is
different from 4%. Well, different can be smaller or larger. So, to be
fair, this is what we should actually do:</p>
<p><img src="fig/03-two-sided-significance.png" alt="Binomial null distribution with two-sided significance indicated." width="500" class="figure"> We should look on both sides of the distribution and ask
what outcomes are unlikely. For this, we split the 5% significance to
2.5% on each side. That way, we will reject everything below 1, or above
8. The alternative hypothesis is now that the prevalence is different
from 4%.</p>
<p>But what exactly was wrong with a one-sided test? An observation of 9
is clearly higher than the expected 4, so no need to test on the other
side, right? Unfortunately: no.</p>

<p>What we did is called <strong>HARKing</strong>, which stands for
“hypothesis after results known”, or, also data snooping.<br>
The problem is, we decided on the direction to look at after having seen
at the data, and <strong>this messes with the significance level <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span></strong>. The 5% is just not true
anymore, because we spent all the 5% on one side, and we cheated by
looking into the data to decide which side we want to look at. But if
the null were true, then there would be a (roughly) 50:50 chance that
the test group gives you an outcome that is higher or lower than the
expected value. So we’d have to double the alpha, and in reality it
would be around 10%. This means, assuming the null was true, we actually
had an about 10% chance of falsely rejecting it.</p>

their father. Study participants look at a photo of a baby, and two
photos of adult men, one of which is the father. They have to guess
which of them. The hypothesis is that new-borns resemble their fathers
and the father is thus guessed &gt;50% of the cases. There is no reason
to believe that children resemble their fathers <em>less</em> than they
resemble randomly chosen men.</li>
<li>When looking at the data (only 1 out of 100), it becomes clear that
the prevalence is certainly not increased by the precondition. It might
even <em>decrease</em> the risk. We thus test for that.</li>

<p>In the first and second scenario, one-sided tests could be used.
There are different opinions to how sparsely they should be used. For
example, <a href="https://whitlockschluter.zoology.ubc.ca/" class="external-link">Whitlock and
Schluter</a> gave the second scenario as a potential use-case. They
believe that a one-sided test should only be used if “the null
hypothesis are inconceivable for any reason other than chance”. They
would likely argue against using a one-sided test in the first scenario,
because what if the disease prevalence is decreased due to the
precondition? Wouldn’t we find this interesting as well?</p>

<p>We just learned about data snooping, or HARKing, which is one way of
<em>p-hacking</em>, i.e. cheating to get significant results. Another
example is method hacking, where you try different methods until one of
them gives a significant result.</p>
<p>You might have heard people say that p-hacking (or other things)
<em>increase type I error</em>. Here’s what this means:</p>
<p>If you perform a test and either reject the null hypothesis or not,
there are four possible outcomes:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/04-errors_hypothesis_testing.png" width="600" alt="image of confusion matrix" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Errors in hypothesis testing</div>
</figure><ul>
<li>The favorable classifications are <strong>true negative</strong>,
where you correctly don’t reject the null, and <strong>true
positive</strong>, where you correctly reject it and decide that there
is something interesting to see in your data.<br>
</li>
<li>There are also two ways in which the classification can go wrong.
One is said <strong>false positive</strong>, also called <strong>type I
error</strong>, where the null is incorrectly rejected. This just
happens by chance in a certain percentage of cases. For example, per
definition it happens in 5% of the cases when you choose a significance
level of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span>. But there are
other things that can increase the chances for false positives,
including p-hacking, multiple comparisons (which is part of the next
tutorial), or certain violations of the assumptions
(e.g. independence).<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>False negative</strong> classification or <strong>type
II</strong> error describes the case when the null hypothesis isn’t
rejected even though something interesting is happening. This is likely
to happen if we have too little data, or use methods that are not
powerful enough to detect what we’re looking for. We try to avoid type
II error by choosing methods with a <em>high power</em>.</li>

<p>Let’s get back to the mice example we saw in the beginning. We’ll
first simplify the example a bit: Let’s suppose you measure the weight
of a couple of mice that have been fed with high-fat diet (black dots).
We now want to know whether the mice weights in the test group differ
significantly from a known average mouse weight (blue line).</p>
<figure><img src="fig/05-mouse-weights.png" width="500" alt="graph showing mouse weights of one sample, and a mean to compare them to." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Scenario for one-sided t-test: Comparing mouse
weights to a single value.</div>
</figure><p>In the graph above you see one sample of 20 mice weights, from mice
that had special diet, which average to <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}=26.6\,g\)</span>. We will compare their
weights to a known average mouse weight <span class="math inline">\(mu_0=23.9\,g\)</span>. That means, we
<strong>compare a sample mean to <span class="math inline">\(mu_0\)</span></strong>.</p>

</h3>
<p>In this example, I will explain a t-test, one of the most commonly
used tests. It is used for comparing two groups, or for comparing one
group’s average to a known average. I use the example to demonstrate the
steps of performing a test that are valid for every test:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up the null hypothesis (and the alternative). In this case, that
the mice in the test group (black dots) weigh on average the same as the
known average weight (blue line).<br>
</li>
<li>Come up with a <strong>test statistic</strong>, that is, a number
that summarizes the data points in a useful way. In the t-test, this
statistic is called <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.<br>
</li>
<li>Calculate value for the statistic (<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>) for the given data.<br>
</li>
<li>Calculate how likely it is to observe this value by chance, if the
null hypothesis is true. For the t-test, this means calculating the
probability of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> under the
t-distribution. I will give you two explanations for why the
t-distribution is a useful distribution for this example.<br>
</li>
<li>The calculated probability is the <strong>p-value</strong>, from
which we can decide whether or not to reject the null hypothesis.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="null-and-alternative-hypothesis">Null and alternative hypothesis<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#null-and-alternative-hypothesis"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Null hypothesis:</strong> Mice fed with special diet are no
different from other mice, and the observed difference between sample
mean and mu0 was just by chance.<br><strong>Alternative hypothesis</strong>: The diet makes a difference,
and the sampled mice come from a population where the average weight
differs from <span class="math inline">\(mu_0\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-t-statistic">The t-statistic<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-t-statistic"></a>
</h3>
<p>In the previous example, we had measured one number, namely 9 persons
with disease, of which we could calculate the probability under the
null. This is not the case here: Here we have 20 numbers. Therefore, we
have to help ourselves by summarizing these 20 numbers into something
meaningful.</p>
<p>Here’s what we calculate:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/05-t-statistic.png" width="600" alt="Formula for t-statistic, and graph with moise weights indicating sample mean and mu0" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">The t-statistic is a scaled difference between
sample mean and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span>
</div>
</figure><p>The t- statistic is one value made out of the 20 values in the sample
– a scaled sample mean. In the numerator, we have the difference between
<span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>, the sample mean, and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span>. The denominator is the standard
error of the mean (SEM), which is the sample standard deviation over the
square root of the sample size.</p>
<p>Why is this a useful summary of the data? Because <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> <strong>summarizes how much evidence we
have against the null hypothesis</strong>. This means, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is close to 0 if there is little
evidence, and it becomes large when we have a lot of evidence.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/05-scale.png" width="600" alt="Formula for t-statistic, and image of scale" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">The t-statistic weighs effect size and sample
size against variance.</div>
</figure><p>In other words, we can say that <strong><span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> weighs effect size and sample size
against the variance.</strong></p>
<p>Evidence for a true difference between the weight of high-fat diet
mice and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span> increases (the
absolute value of) <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}-\mu_0\)</span> is the observed
difference between sample mean and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span>. If this difference is increased,
then <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is increased also.<br>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{\sigma}\)</span> is the sample
standard deviation (and in the denominator). If the sample has a high
variance, this decreases the evidence – and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.<br>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the sample size.
Increasing <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> also increases <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, since more data points mean more
evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep this picture in mind, because this weighing of effect size,
sample size, and variance, is essentially what every test does, not only
the t-test. It’s just the calculation, or the statistic used, that
depends on the type of data.</p>

</figure><p>Back to our example: From the data, we can calculate the test
statistic <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, which in this case is
<span class="math inline">\(t=2.57\)</span>. All that’s left to do is to
look up whether a value as large as <span class="math inline">\(2.57\)</span> is surprising or not under the null
distribution, which for the t-test is the t-distribution. The null
distribution allows us to calculate how likely it is to observe a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> with an absolute value as large or
larger than <span class="math inline">\(2.57\)</span>, assuming that the
data mean is <span class="math inline">\(mu_0=23.9\)</span>. This
probability under the null is <span class="math inline">\(p=0.019\)</span> for the given data. This means we
can reject the null at a 5% significance level. We conclude that the
data mean is different from <span class="math inline">\(mu_0\)</span>,
and that the mice on the special diet have a different weight from the
known average. In the next section, you will learn what the
t-distribution is and why it is a good distribution for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>

<p>Let me sum up what we know now:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have a sample of mice weights and a weight <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span> that we compare these weights to.
We want to know whether the average weight differs from <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span>.<br>
</li>
<li>We calculated <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> for this
specific sample. <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is a scaled
difference between sample mean and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span>. In case the sample mean is the
same as <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> should be close to zero.<br>
</li>
<li>Moreover, the central limit theorem tells us that, if high fat diet
mice in general don’t differ from <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span> in their weight, we can expect
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> to come from a standard normal
distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means, that if we sample again and again (i.e. the experiment
where 20 mice were fed with special diet and weighed, and a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> was calculated), we should measure a
different <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> each time, and plotting
the a histogram or density of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>s
will give a Gaussian bell shape.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-distribution-of-t-in-practice">The distribution of t in practice<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-distribution-of-t-in-practice"></a>
</h3>
<p>In theory, this would be enough to calculate a p-value, but sometimes
the devil is in the details. The Central Limit Theorem tells us that
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> will behave like drawn from a
normal distribution “if we have enough data points”. So do we have
enough data points in our example to be able to use it? It turns out in
practice that for samples that have less than ~30 data points, the CLT
doesn’t hold, and the values of t that we calculate from the data, don’t
follow a normal distribution.</p>
<p>The distribution of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>s looks
perfectly normal “in the middle”, but not at the <em>tails</em>: We say
that the distribution has <em>heavy tails</em>, because <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> tends to take extreme values (extremely
small or extremely large) more often than we would expect from a normal
distribution.</p>
<p>The good news is, we can still run a test on small samples, by using
the <em><span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution</em> as a
null distribution for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. This
distribution looks like the normal distribution, but with heavy tails.
It has one parameter, <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span>, which
specifies the degrees of freedom. Without going into detail, <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> is closely connected to the number of
data points (for a one-sample t-test, <span class="math inline">\(\nu=N-1\)</span>). In the figure below, you see
how the t-distribution changes with the sample size:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/Student_t_pdf.svg" width="500" alt="Graph showing t-distribution" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">The t distribution for different degrees of
freedom (wikipedia)</div>
</figure><p>For large samples, i.e. high values of <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span>, the heavy tails vanish and the
t-distribution becomes more and more similar to a normal distribution,
which is exactly what the central limit theorem tells us.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> We can use the t-distribution as a null
distribution for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, without
worrying about the sample size.</p>

<p>For our example, you already calculated <span class="math inline">\(t=2.57\)</span> from the data for the mice on
diet. As a reminder:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb1">
<h3 class="code-label">R<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

</div>
<p>We can now compute the p-value using the t-distribution:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb2">
<h3 class="code-label">R<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

</div>
<p>In words, we define the parameter of the t-distribution
<code>df</code>, based on the number of data points. We calculate the
probability of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> being at least
<span class="math inline">\(2.57\)</span> under the t-distribution
(using the function <code>pt</code>), and then we multiply the result by
<span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> for making the result
two-sided.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conclusion"></a>
</h3>
<p>At the end of the day, we can reject the null hypothesis that the
sample mean equals <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span> at a 5%
significance level. We conclude that the mice fed with the special diet
have a different average weight than the known average weight of mice
fed with a “normal” diet.</p>

<p>…the worst part is over! If you could follow until here, you
understood the essence of the t-test. Everything that follows is just
practical details.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>So far, I explained the t-test using one sample that was compared to
a known number. More commonly, two samples are compared. For example, in
the scenario I depicted at the beginning of this tutorial, the sample of
mice on high fat diet were compared to a group of mice fed with a
control diet.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/HT-08-two-sample-t-test-rendered-unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>The approach for testing stays the same. We still summarize the data
into a statistic called <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and then
calculate its probability under the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>The only thing that changes is the formula for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. For two samples, it’s<br><span class="math display">\[t= \frac{\bar{x}-\bar{y}}{SE}\]</span> with
<span class="math display">\[SE=
\sqrt{\frac{\hat{\sigma}_x^2+\hat{\sigma}_y^2}{n}}.\]</span></p>
<p>for equal variances and sample size. If <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is correct, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> follows a t-distribution with <span class="math inline">\(n_x+n_y-2\)</span> degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>This means <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> still compares
effect size, sample size and variance. The effect size is now the
difference between the two sample means.</p>
<p>The formula gets more complicated when the assumptions of equal
variances and sample sizes don’t hold, which is often the case. But the
good news is: You don’t have to remember any of these formulae, nor the
parameters of the null distribution. Any statistics program will do this
for you. The important thing is that you know how to interpret the
results.</p>
<p>By the way, for the two samples comparing the diets, we get <span class="math inline">\(t=-2.05\)</span> and a p-value of <span class="math inline">\(p=0.053\)</span>. For this sample, we can’t reject
the null hypothesis at a 5% significance level. Fortunately, the data
for this example was only a small subset of the original data set. The
researchers who performed the experiment had enough data points (and
thus evidence) to <a href="https://doi.org/10.2337/diabetes.53.suppl_3.S215" class="external-link">clearly
demonstrate that the high-fat diet leads to heaver mice</a>.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="pairing-data">Pairing data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#pairing-data"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Let’s assume the experiment had looked a little different: Let’s say
there is only one group of mice, and each mouse in that group was
measured, then fed with special diet for a month, and then measured
again. For each mouse we have now two data points. This is visualized
below:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/HT-08-two-sample-t-test-rendered-unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>We see a trend that after one month, the mice might be a bit heavier.
The difference in means is <span class="math inline">\(2.06\,g\)</span>,
but due to the high variance, a non-paired two-sample t-test is not
significant (<span class="math inline">\(p=0.31\)</span>).</p>
<p>Here is the test run in R:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb1">
<h3 class="code-label">R<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

</div>
<div class="codewrapper">
<h3 class="code-label">OUTPUT<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

<pre class="output" tabindex="0"><code>

</div>
<p>However, this test completely neglects the information of which two
data points come from the same mouse. Therefore, let’s consider another
plot, where each two data points that belong to the same mouse are
connected with a line. We say that these data points are <em>paired</em>
by the mouse identity.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/HT-08-two-sample-t-test-rendered-unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Now it seems clear that each mouse gained a small amount of weight,
something that has been obscured before by the high variance of the
individual mice weights. In fact, we can also plot the individual weight
differences only (right plot) to make the point that every single mouse
has gained a small amount of weight.</p>
<p>The paired t-test is based on the individual difference between
paired data points. It has the null hypothesis that these differences
are zero. This brings the scenario down to a one-sample t-test: We look
at the individual weight differences and test whether they are different
from zero. The estimated effect size, namely the weight difference,
stays the same. But the p-value drops dramatically, as you can see in
the below code:</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Therefore we say that the paired t-test has an increased power
compared to the unpaired two-sample t-test. Power describes the chance
of detecting an effect with your test, if this effect exists. In this
example, there is an effect (I can assure you, because I simulated the
data). And the paired test detected it, while the unpaired didn’t. The
reason is simple: There are two sources of randomness in the data:</p>
<ul>
<li>The individual responses to the treatment and</li>
<li>mice have different weights to start with.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the paired design, we can control for the latter of these sources
of noise.</p>

<figure><img src="fig/HT-09-interpreting-p-values-rendered-irrelevant-diff-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>The responses in two treatment groups A and B were compared to decide
whether the new treatment B has a different effect than the well-known
treatment A. All measurements are shown, and a p-value of an unpaired
two-sample t-test was reported.</p>
<p>Have a coffee and think about what you conclude about the new
treatment…</p>
<figure><img src="fig/A_small_cup_of_coffee.JPG" width="500" alt="image showing a cup of coffee" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Have a coffee! (Image: Wikimedia)</div>
</figure><p>So, if you were in pharmaceutical business: Would you decide to
continue research on treatment B? It evokes a higher (presume: better)
response than A, and will therefore sell better. The difference is
clearly significant. Right…?<br>
Yes, right. But how much better is the response in B? The average
difference in response is <span class="math inline">\(0.2\)</span>,
which is only 2%. To distract from that, the y-axis of the above graph
starts at 7 – while to be honest with the viewer, it should start at
zero. Remember that a p-value can be small due to a large effect size,
low variance, or large sample size. In this case, it’s the latter. A
huge number of data points will make even the smallest difference
statistically significant. It is questionable whether an improvement of
2% is biologically relevant, and make drug B the new bestseller.<br>
The lesson to be learned here is therefore, that <strong>statistically
significant is not the same as biologically relevant</strong>, and
reporting, or relying on a p-value alone will not give the full picture.
You should always report the effect size as well, and ideally also show
the data.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In other fields, 2% can, of course, be a
highly relevant difference.</p>

<ul>
<li>The p-value is the probability that the observed data could happen,
under the condition that the null hypothesis is true. It is <em>not</em>
the probability that the null hypothesis is true.<br>
</li>
<li>Keep in mind that <strong>absence of evidence is not evidence of
absence</strong>. If you didn’t see a significant effect, it doesn’t
mean that there is no effect. It could also be that your data simply
doesn’t hold enough evidence to demonstrate it – i.e. you have too
little data points for the given variance and effect size.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Significance levels are arbitrary.</strong> It therefore
makes no sense to interpret a p-value of <span class="math inline">\(p=0.049\)</span> much different from <span class="math inline">\(p=0.051\)</span>. They are both suggesting that
there is likely something to see in your data that is worth following
up, and none of them should terminally convince us that the alternative
hypothesis is true.</li>
