## About this lesson

This lesson was condensed from two existing lessons on [statistical distributions](https://sarahkaspar.github.io/biostatistics-course/) and [hypothesis testing](https://sarahkaspar.github.io/hypothesis-testing/instructor/index.html). It is created to serve as theoretical background for a live coding session to be delivered at EMBL. 

The goal of the live session is to walk you through a workflow of inspecting the a data set and running a simple hypothesis test on it. In the session we will 

- visualize the raw data
- visualize the distribution of the data to check for the assumption that it follows a normal distribution
- run a t-test
- add the p-value to the raw data plot

While we assume that you have some basic coding skills in either R or Python, you can go through this lesson to understand 

- what statistical distributions are
- the properties of the normal distribution
- how histogram, ECDF and QQ-plot allow you to compare your data to a normal distribution
- what the idea behind a hypothesis test is
- what a t-test is
- what one-sided/two-sided and unpaired/paired tests are.
